Tony Rivera is a 37 years old Toy Photographer from New York, United States. 


## What led you into toy photography?

Toys are a big part of many people's childhood, including mine. **I always loved and admired toys as a child and it has grew up with me as an adult.** I always held those values in me. It's a very fun hobby. There are no limits to what you can do with your figures, which makes it so much fun, whether I am home with my dioramas or outside. 

It started when I got my very first point and shoot camera years ago. I always loved hiking in the mountains and walking in the city with my camera, shooting photos. So with that, **I would also bring my toys on my adventures to photograph**. It was always fun. I got more serious about it when I eventually upgraded and bought myself a DSLR camera. 


## What's your motivation?

**Nostalgia plays a big role.** A lot of toys I own are of characters I admired as a child and teen, like movie, comic and game characters I love. Photographing them is always loads of fun.

## What's your gear?

I own 2 DSLRs but I primarily use my Canon 7D for toy photography. The lens I use is a Tamron 16-300mm lens. It can shoot wide and close macro shots which is perfect for toy photography. A tripod and two extra batteries.


## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

For photography indoor at home, I set up one of my dioramas to display for a shoot. I choose a set of figures and accessories to shoot. It depends on my mood on which kind of figures to shoot for the session. **I set up my lights, vapor, music player and figure stands on the table.**

For outdoor photography, it's the same except that I don't need dioramas, I just use the landscape as the setting. 


## Any advice for a beginner?

**Get out there and shoot.** Get a light source like a booklight, as good lighting is a very important aspect of photography. Be creative, try different things to your liking. Go outside and bring your toys with you. Scout and find a good place for a shoot. The park. A landscape. A river. The city. 

**There are no limits to what you can do to be creative.** Dioramas are also very good for toy photography if you can't do outdoor photography. Photo editing software is very important as it enhances your photos even further and you also need adjust your photos.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

That's easy for me to choose!  It's my NECA Toys TMNT Raphael in Disguise — trench coat — figure, 18 inch scale. As a city lover, I absolutely love taking that figure with me to the city. I live near New York City. I have taken Raphael on many, many adventures in the city. Times Square, The Brooklyn Bridge, The Empire State Building, Central Park, Union Square. 

**And also recreating scenes from actual real locations from the movie in the city**, like the courthouse, the subway station where April was ambushed, etc. from the original TMNT movie. I have a huge collection of photos I have shared on Instagram of Raphael in the city and many more I have not posted yet. That figure is my number one toy companion on my outdoor toy adventures. It really is special to me.
